## Key Insights from PERLA

The living database enables observation of evolutionary trends in perovskite solar cell research:

- **Performance Evolution** - Trajectories in voltage loss reduction and efficiency improvements over time
- **Architectural Changes** - Shifts toward inverted (p-i-n) structures with self-assembled monolayers (SAMs)
- **Compositional Trends** - Transitions from methylammonium (MA)-dominated to formamidinium (FA)-rich mixed-cation perovskites
- **Bandgap Distribution** - Evolution toward the optimal 1.50-1.55 eV range for single-junction devices

These trends emerge from continuous integration of post-2021 literature, demonstrating the value of automated, physics-validated data extraction for materials science research.
